Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nCyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nAs per analysis concluded by the finance team, it is found that customers holding membership ride provide more profit than casual riders. In spite of having a flexible plan, managing director believes that company’s key future growth depends on maximum no of annual memberships.\n\nHence, **goal of this case study aims at providing a design marketing strategy in order to convert casual riders into annual membership riders.**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Identifying stakeholders\n* **Cyclistic:** A bike share program that has nearly 5800 bikes and 600 docking stations, which offers 3 type of bikes- hand bicylces, reclining bikes & cargo bikes, which could also help provide services to people with disabilities and to the people who cant stand on 2-wheeled bikes.\n* **Lily Moreno:** Managing director of Cyclistic program, who is responsible for development of campaigns and initiative to promote the bike share program.\n* **Cyclistic executive team:** are responsible for approving the recommendment marketing stratergy designed for the present case study.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Business task:**\n* The case study aims at converting the casual rider users to membership rider users.\n* With the datasets available from the companies database, we shall analyse the current datasets of CY-2021 and proceed with our analysis.\n* Based on the historical data, we can analyse and compare our findings seperately for casual and annual membership holders and identify trends for the same.\n* This could help us design a marketing strategy in order to boost profit of the company.\n* We shall have our analysis, visualization and key finding presented to the stake holders along with recommendation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data collection:\n* Data have been collected from the reliable source.

Membership riders on weekends can be provided with special offers, discounts or copouns, along with flexible pricing plan which is available presently.\n* To make rides to be economic friendly, no of bikes of electric bike type can be increased and be kept accessed at maximum frequently used dockstations.\n* Since no of rides have been found to be less during winter seasons, special offers can be added during those seasons for memberships riders, in order to boost the ride numbers.\n* Customer feeback surveys can collected for their experience of use as casual and membership riders and analysed for further investigation.","metadata":{}}]}
